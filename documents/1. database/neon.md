# Database provider provides a development branch of your db

[Neon](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/signing-up#about-branching) provides you a development branch that is perfect for using drizzle-push while you develop 

You can obtain two diffrent URIs for your postgresql datbase instance

**In reald world OROJECT I suggest that you handle two URIs like `DATABASE_URL_PROD` AND `DATABASE_URL_DEV` inside `/src/env.ts` file**

# Neon also provide temp databse for 48 or 72 hours without you being required to have neon account
